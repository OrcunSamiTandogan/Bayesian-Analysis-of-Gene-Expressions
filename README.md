# Bayesian-Analysis-of-Gene-Expressions
Our subject is the weaning of beef calves. Data belongs to immune cells, leukocyte transcriptome, and our data extracted from 4 different days of beef calves. 2 treatments have been done on the beef calves. Bayesian analysis has been implemented on this data by Pymc3. The nice part is that Bayesian allows us to see the means of the power of expression in %94 HDI and we are able to compare effects.
